# BERT-toxic-comment-classifier
In this project we implement a state-of-art classifier with BERT (Language Model) by experimenting various performance improving strategies. We also have implemented an application which scrapes tweets from Twitter for any given user and runs the toxic comment classifier to yield the final output containing the reported tweets, associated toxic labels and confidence levels.
